    PyRoom is a free editor that stays out your way - and keeps other things out
	of your way, too. As a fullscreen editor without buttons, widgets,
	formatting options, menus and with only the minimum of required dialog
	windows, it doesn't have any distractions and lets you focus on writing and
	only writing. It is distributed under the GNU General Public Licence v3.
