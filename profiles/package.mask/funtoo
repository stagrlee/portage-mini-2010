# let's stick with a known-good version of ruby by
# default, and protect against ruby-1.9.2 things that
# seem broken:
>dev-lang/ruby-1.8.7_p299
>=dev-lang/ruby-1.9.2
>=dev-ruby/rdoc-2.5.11

# Group python-3-specific ebuilds here - they should
# all be masked for now to avoid situations where
# deps cannot be satisfied due to python-3 not being
# available. We want the python-2 version of the
# ebuild to be the most recent for stable and 
# unstable to avoid this problem:

>=net-zope/zope-interface-3.6.1

# If you want to use mysql-community, unmask it and mask dev-db/mysql.
# Having both unmasked causes "emerge dev-db/mysql" to fail, which is
# not optimal.
