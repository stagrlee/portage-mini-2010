ABOUT THIS DIRECTORY
====================

This is a NEW, improved layout that Daniel is working on. It is UNTESTED and
likely has bugs, especially in parents files. This layout was developed on
Monday, February 28, 2011. The goal of the funtoo/1.0/linux-gnu directory is to
house everything that was in the funtoo/1.0/ directory - basically, linux-gnu
is the implicit platform, so we have it right after 1.0 and remove a lot of
complexity in the directory structure.

Changes
=======

Also new in this design is a "stable" and "current" profile! The intention is
that the user will select "stable" or "current" via a profile selection rather
than manually modifying ACCEPT_KEYWORDS in /etc/make.conf. This allows *other*
things to be changed between stable and current, such as virtuals settings, and
is a lot more flexible.

Another change related to this is moving the funtoo-stable package.keywords
file to a package.unmask file inside the builds/stable profile. This is easier
to maintain and architecture agnostic.

Yet another change is renaming "arch/x86" to "arch/x86-32bit" and "arch/amd64"
to "arch/x86-64bit".  These names are more easily understood by end-users. No
changes have been made to KEYWORDS names.

New Conventions
===============

Sub-directories where you are supposed to select only one option are in
singular form. (platform, arch, build) Sub-directories where you may select
more than one option are in plural form. (mix-ins)
